AI and Python Programming Assignments

This repository contains the solutions for two programming assignments designed to build foundational skills in Python programming and Artificial Intelligence concepts.

The first assignment is a Number Guessing Game, where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user guesses the number with feedback and error handling. 

The second assignment involves setting up and running AI-related code using the aima-python library to simulate intelligent agent behavior.
